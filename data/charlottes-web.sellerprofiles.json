  "storyLong": "This shop began as a way to help my mom, Charlotte, who is older and living with memory changes. Over the years she collected duplicate items—brand-new, still in the box—from storage solutions to household essentials. Rather than let these useful items go to waste, we're re-homing them to people who need them. Thank you for helping us turn extras into essentials for someone else, all while honoring Mom's legacy of thoughtful collecting and care.",
